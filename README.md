#AST Explorer
This is a tool to visually explore Abstract Syntax Trees. I wrote it as a part of my Bachelor Thesis about the automated detection of cross-language links (http://www.xllsrc.net) at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München.


Needs the ast-parsers project to compile. Might also require the JDK on the classpath (for the JavaFX API).
